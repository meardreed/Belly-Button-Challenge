# Belly Button Challenge

In this challenge, we are building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that 
colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, 
while the rest were relatively rare.
